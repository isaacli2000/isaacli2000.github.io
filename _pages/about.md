I'm a second-year master's student at the University of International Relations. My research interests primarily include large model fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and natural language processing, with a recent focus on retrieval research, especially generative retrieval. I am passionate about advancing AI's ability to handle complex language tasks and am currently exploring ways to improve the accuracy and efficiency of generative retrieval systems.
